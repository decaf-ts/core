# Decaf TS — Core Package

Decaf Core provides the foundational building blocks for the Decaf TypeScript ecosystem: strongly-typed models, repository pattern, pluggable persistence adapters, a composable query DSL, and pagination/observer utilities. With decorators and an injectable registry, it wires models to repositories and adapters so you can build data access that is framework-agnostic yet fully typed.
