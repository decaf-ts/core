## Core Module

The Decaf TypeScript Core Module is a comprehensive framework that provides a robust foundation for building TypeScript applications with data persistence capabilities. It offers a flexible model-repository architecture with support for various storage mechanisms, relationship management, querying capabilities, and reactive programming through the Observer pattern. The framework simplifies data handling with decorators for model definition, identity management, and persistence operations while maintaining type safety throughout.
