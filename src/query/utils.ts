/**
 * @description
 * Map of supported operators to their corresponding parser functions.
 *
 * @summary
 * The `OperatorsMap` defines a collection of operator names as keys
 * (such as `Equals`, `LessThan`, `Between`, etc.), each mapped to a
 * function that constructs a `Condition` object for that operator.
 * These functions translate query clauses into concrete condition
 * builders, enabling dynamic query construction from method names.
 *
 * @template T The type of the field values used in conditions.
 *
 * @param f {string} - The field name the condition applies to.
 * @param v1 {any} - The value to compare the field against or the lower bound value for range-based operators.
 * @param v2 {any} - The upper bound value for range-based operators.
 *
 * @return {Condition<any>} A condition object representing the operator applied to the field.
 *
